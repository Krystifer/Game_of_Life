# Game_of_Life
Welcome to this repository, here is an introductory exploration into the captivating world of cellular automata, with the renowned Game of Life serving as a prominent example. This project emerged within the framework of the esteemed annual science fair "Carpa de Melquiades" in Cali. The repository content is centred around the implementation of the Game of Life in LED matrices, meticulously documented through a comprehensive technical manual and complemented by an Arduino code. Also, a Python simulation, an engaging motivational document, and an initial mathematical analysis. While the latter may not attain full rigour, it presents valuable insights, particularly within the context of an introductory Functional Analysis course. As the author, I extend my heartfelt appreciation to Jaime Alfonso Arango Cabarcas, a distinguished Professor at Universidad del Valle in the Mathematics Department (jaime.arango@correounivalle.edu.co). His unwavering support and motivation have been indispensable, not only in this project but across various other endeavours.
